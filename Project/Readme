This is a research project based on the paper "High Quality Protein Q8 Secondary Structure Prediction by Diverse Neural Network Architectures" by Jian Zhou, Olga G. Troyanskaya, and Jian Peng.

The Q8 refers to the 8 states of secondary structures in proteins: alpha helix (H), beta strand (E), coil (C), 3-10 helix (G), pi helix (I), beta bridge (B), turn (T), and bend (S). 
Accurate prediction of these secondary structures is crucial for understanding protein function and interactions.

The key aspects of the approach can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: Removed redundant cells that lead to overfitting as they came in both training and testing values. After the filtration, the new data was used.

3. **Features and Output Classes**: 46 features per residue was used to classify each residue into one of 8 classes. These features included one-hot encoding for residue type, residue profiles from PSI-BLAST, and binary features indicating the sequence's start and end positions.

4. **Neural Network Architectures**: Four diverse neural network architectures, each with different structures and characteristics were explored. These architectures included Bidirectional LSTMs with Attention: 64.10, Bidirectional GRU with Convolutional Blocks, Temporal Convolutional  Network, and Bidirectional GRU with 2D  Convolution.

5. **Training and Evaluation**: The architectures were trained on the filtered dataset and the results were noted as follows - 
    a. Bidirectional LSTMs with Attention: 64.10  ( Mean Accuracy ) 
    b. Bidirectional GRU with Convolutional Blocks : 62.04 ( Mean Accuracy )
    c. Temporal Convolutional  Network : 60.25  ( Mean Accuracy )
    d. Bidirectional GRU with 2D  Convolution: 68.30 ( Mean Accuracy )
